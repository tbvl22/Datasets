- The videos are divided into two parts: **take_01** and **take_02**, as each sign was recorded twice.  
- Videos are further organized **subject-wise**, with each subject having a separate folder.  
- **video_info.csv** contains metadata for all videos, including:
  - **Path**
  - **Sign**
  - **Subject**
  - **Camera**
- To efficiently organize the dataset for training and testing, video paths and sign labels are stored in the following files:  
  - **train_c1.csv** – Training videos from Camera 1  
  - **test_c1.csv** – Testing videos from Camera 1  
  - **train_c2.csv** – Training videos from Camera 2  
  - **test_c2.csv** – Testing videos from Camera 2
